            <p>$USN is a NEAR-native stablecoin that can adapt to both bull and bear market conditions, with different mechanisms depending on its phase. Currently we are at phase I and $USN is 1:1 collateralized by $USDT, although other battle-tested stablecoins such as $USDC or $DAI will be added in the future. As the market recovers $USN might transition to phase II, and it will be also backed by non-stable assets such as $NEAR, $BTC or $ETH.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Besides, $USN generates a sustainable yield that comes from native NEAR staking rewards. Combining the security of $USDT, the decentralization of $FRAX and the yield opportunities, $USN is positioned to be one of the most effective ways to bootstrap liquidity in the NEAR ecosystem; all while adding a new layer of composability to $NEAR. $USN’s smart contracts and Reserve Fund are managed by the Decentral Bank DAO.</>

However, given the importance of building liquidity, at the beginning $USN rewards will be distributed to liquidity pools in AMMs such as Ref Finance and Trisolaris. Later, you could also enjoy $USN rewards on Money Market protocols such as Burrow, Bastion or Aurigamy, and in orderbooks such as Orderly, Spin or Tonic. Finally, $USN will be integrated across the whole NEAR ecosystem.

            <p>$USN’s peg to the US Dollar is secured through a 1:1 backing with $USDT. The main on-chain contract mechanism always allows users to mint 1 $USN for 1 $USDT and redeem 1 $USN for 1 $USDT.</p>
            </br>
            <p>The peg can be controlled via arbitrage opportunities. $USN is freely traded on the open market in decentralized protocols such as Ref Finance and Trisolaris and soon in CEXes. Therefore:</p>

                <li>&nbsp;<b>•</b> If $USN trades above $1.00, then users can mint 1 $USN via the on-chain mechanism with 1 $USDT and then sell it in the open market for 1.01 $USDT, profiting 0.01 $USDT.</li>
            </ul>
            </br>
            <p>In the future, $USN can be supported by a tri- or quadri-pool of stablecoins as new assets are added to the Reserves.</p>

        // p2: '$USN combines some of the best approaches to stablecoins as a semi-algorithmic stablecoin with an on-chain arbitrage mechanism backed by $NEAR, as well as $USDT at launch. Through an on-chain arbitrage model, $USN untaps the growth potential of $UST, while securing a strong peg defense like $FRAX through a self-balancing reserve. Furthermore, while the $USN Reserve Fund is initially double-collateralized by $NEAR and $USDT, there is no overcollateralization on the part of the user; 1 $USN will always be minted for $1 worth of $NEAR.',

            1. $USN can be minted through the main on-chain contract mechanism that mints / redeems $USN with $USDT via:
            <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Decentral Bank’s swap tool (coming soon!)

            2. $USN can be freely traded on DEXes:
            <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Ref Finance on $NEAR [<a href="https://app.ref.finance/">https://app.ref.finance/</a>]

            3. Soon, $USN will be available on CEXes as well
            <br/>
            4. $USN will also be available to make payments on off-chain applications and real-world commerce. Please see roadmap for more details

        title: 'How Does $USN compare to other stablecoins?',
        content: `<p>
            The main difference between $USN and the rest of stablecoins is that its design is flexible and not fixed, allowing $USN to adapt to different market conditions. Decentral Bank’s goal has been to create a stablecoin that is the closest to being truly stable; one that can thrive in a bull run and withstand a prolonged bear market.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
            Under the current design, $USN offers a truly reliable solution since it is 1:1 backed with $USDT while generating rewards via $NEAR staking. The combination of security and yield opportunity makes it a very attractive option for a bear market.
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
            Also, no other stablecoin has seen a whole ecosystem built around itself. $USN will be integrated in all major $NEAR and $AURORA dApps and the users will enjoy a seamless experience that hasn’t been yet possible in other blockchains. $NEAR sharding technology makes $USN fast, secure, truly interoperable and composable between shards/chains. $USN will also unlock the potential that exists between connecting the on-chain with the off-chain world.

            $USN stands out for several reasons:
            </br>
            </br>
            <ul>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>•</b> Safe and design, as it is 1:1 backed by a basket of battle-tested stablecoins, making $USN thrive at stability</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>•</b> The generation of a native yield thanks to NEAR staking rewards</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>•</b> Extra yield due to third party DeFi protocols: protocol incentives, added revenue due to borrowing costs, etc</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>•</b> Seamless integration of $USN across the whole $NEAR and $AURORA ecosystems, which makes $USN a comfortable method of exchange and use of any major DeFi or infrastructure protocol</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>•</b> $USN is the only stablecoin that offers a truly composable cross-chain interoperability between different chains thanks to the sharding design of $NEAR. This means that $USN transactions can be executed on L2 solutions such as Aurora or any other shard without the user directly interacting with these other shards.</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>•</b> $USN will become backbone of transitions in $NEAR</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>•</b> Cheap and fast cross-border transactions leveraging NEAR Protocol’s infrastructure</li>
                <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>•</b> Ease of access: directly mint $USN through the web wallets using $USDT</li>
